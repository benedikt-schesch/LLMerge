Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this merge conflict between the two code snippets provided. The user is asking for a semantic merge conflict resolution expert, and the task is to merge two JSON objects while preserving their original structure and context. The user provided a snippet where the first object is in the first snippet, and the second one is in the second snippet. My job is to merge them correctly.

First, I'll look at the context given. The first snippet is in the `<code>` block, and the second snippet is also in the `<code>` block. They're both JSON objects with specific keys and values. The goal is to merge these two objects into one, maintaining the original structure.

I notice that the first snippet has a section that ends with `break;`, which suggests that it's part of a loop. The second snippet doesn't have a `break;`, so it's not part of a loop. That's important because it means the first snippet needs to end before the second one continues.

The task is to merge these objects, so I'll need to iterate through each key in the first snippet and check if that key exists in the second snippet. If it does, I'll take the value from the second snippet; if not, I'll use the value from the first snippet.

I should also preserve the original context, which means keeping the same key-value pairs and their order. So, I'll create a result object that starts empty and then adds each key-value pair from the first snippet, checking the second snippet for a match before adding the first snippet's value.

I'll need to make sure that the merged object doesn't lose any context from the first snippet and that the second snippet's values don't overwrite the first snippet's if they exist. This way, the merged object remains as close as possible to the original, maintaining readability and context.

I should also consider if there are any edge cases, like if one object is empty or if there are conflicting keys. Handling these cases is important to ensure the merge is robust and doesn't cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Finally, I'll structure the code to read the first snippet, iterate through each key, check the second snippet, and build the result object accordingly, ensuring that the original structure is maintained.
