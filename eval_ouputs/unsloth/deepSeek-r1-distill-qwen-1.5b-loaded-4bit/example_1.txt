Below is a snippet of code with surrounding context that includes a merge conflict.
Return the entire snippet (including full context) in markdown code fences as provided, make sure you do not modify the context at all and preserve the spacing as is.
Think in terms of intent and semantics that both sides of the merge are trying to achieve.
If you are not sure on how to resolve the conflict or if the intent is ambiguous, please return the same snippet with the conflict.
Here is the code snippet:
```java
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return data.isEmpty();
    }

    @Override
<<<<<<< HEAD
    public DoubleColumn appendCell(String object) {

        } catch (final NumberFormatException e) {
            throw new NumberFormatException(name() + ": " + e.getMessage());
        }

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this semantic merge conflict. The user provided a snippet with a class `Data` and a method `appendCell`, and the current version of the code is from the semantic version. The existing code uses `append(convert(object))` which might be causing issues because `convert()` is not defined in the provided context.

First, I should look at what `convert()` is supposed to do. Since it's not defined here, I might need to infer its purpose. Maybe it's a method that converts the object into a format compatible with the `Data` class. If that's the case, I can't use it directly.

I need to decide whether to replace the existing method with the new one or use the old one. The new method uses `convert()`, which implies it's more appropriate. But since `convert()` isn't available, maybe the intention was to use a placeholder. Alternatively, perhaps the `Data` class has some specific requirements that `convert()` should fulfill.

I should also consider error handling. If `convert()` throws a `NumberFormatException`, it should be caught and wrapped into another exception. That way, any issues during conversion are caught early, preventing potential bugs.

Another point is the naming convention. The existing code uses `appendCell`, which is standard. The new method should maintain consistency in naming. I should make sure the new method follows the same naming pattern.

I also need to think about how to handle any exceptions that might occur during the `appendCell` method. If an exception is thrown, it should be caught and wrapped in a way that doesn't affect the flow of the application, perhaps by rethrowing it in a specific exception class.

I should also consider whether the `Data` class is designed to handle exceptions. If it does, then the existing method might not be appropriate. But without knowing the exact requirements of `Data`, it's safer to assume that exceptions are possible.

In conclusion, the best approach is to replace the existing `appendCell` method with the new one that uses `convert()`, handle exceptions properly, and ensure the naming convention is maintained.

        try {
            append(convert(object));
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            throw new NumberFormatException(name() + ": " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    @Override
    public DoubleColumn appendCell(final String object) {
        try {
            append(convert(object));
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            throw new NumberFormatException(name() + ": " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
